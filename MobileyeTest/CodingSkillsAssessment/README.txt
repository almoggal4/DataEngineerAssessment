How to Execute:

You will have 2 Python files and one directory:
1. Firstly, you can run the program "Mobileyeprocess.py" (which will run the process and create the DB). Just MAKE SURE that the DB_path (global variable) is fine with you and that the Monitor_Directory_Path (global variable) is configured correctly.

2. Then you have another file called "MobileyeDatabase.py," which contains a class of SQLite 3 DB, and underneath it is a short code that shows the functions I added to the class (for users to perform common queries) - DON'T MISS IT.

3. For opening the DB file, I downloaded from the internet an application called "DB Browser (SQLITE).".

4. The code is fully documented. If you have further questions or something seems wrong to you, please let me know.Â
